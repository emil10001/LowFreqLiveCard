LowFreqLiveCard
===============

Example of a low frequency LiveCard using GDK for Google Glass

A couple of notes, launch with:

    'Ok Glass, start my awesome app'

This displays random data, it is not correct, and Glass does not have a built in HRM that I'm aware of.

[Instructions for importing into IntelliJ.](http://www.recursiverobot.com/post/84081134683/ide-imports-part-3-gradle-gdk-with-intellij) A note on this one, you’ll actually import this as a Gradle project, not ‘from existing sources’. Everything should be configured correctly to allow it to be imported as a Gradle project.
